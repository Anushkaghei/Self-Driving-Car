## ABSTRACT
This project entails an obstacle-avoiding self-driving car based on Arduino that can navigate its environment autonomously. The vehicle is equipped with ultrasonic sensors and a colour sensor that detect obstacles, identifies the red and green colour, software that processes sensor data and makes navigation decisions.

## WORKING OF THE MODEL
* Ultrasonic sensors are mounted on the car, typically facing forward, determine the distance to the object.
* The colour sensors recognise red or green colours , makes the car stop if red and continues when green.
* The Arduino microcontroller reads the sensor data and uses it to control the movement of the car. If an obstacle is detected in front of the car, the Arduino will instruct the car to change direction to avoid it.
* The Arduino can also control the speed and direction of the car's movement based on the sensor data. 

## COMPONENTS USED
